I am a PhD student at Prof. [Patrick Barth](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/barth-lab/)'s lab at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. I am working on applying deep learing methods on protein structure prediction and drug discovery.

I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/yang.j.lin/), reading and travel.
